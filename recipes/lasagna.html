        <h1>Lasagna</h1>
        <img src="../images/lasagna.jpg" alt="An Image Of Lasagna">
        <p>Lasagna is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and spices. The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted during baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square or rectangular portions.</p>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>

            <li>1 can (15 ounces) tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (125 ml) chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (125 ml) fresh basil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of fennel seeds</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon of pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (65 ml) + 2 tablespoons fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1 lb (453 g) lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>850 grams of ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
            <li>453g grated mozzarella</li>
            <li>1 cup (250 ml) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by putting the butter, the olive oil, the peeled and chopped onion and the minced garlic in a large casserole dish.</li>
            <li>Cut the pancetta into pieces.</li>
            <li>Add it to the pot</li>
            <li>Let everything cook slowly. Meanwhile, cut into small pieces not too small, the celery stalks.</li>
            <li>Peeled carrots</li>
            <li>It's already starting to smell divine!</li>
            <li>Pour the white wine</li>
            <li>And minced meat</li>
            <li>Cook until all the liquid has evaporated and the fat comes out.</li>
            <li>Pour in the passata</li>
            <li>Add sugar and full cream</li>
            <li>Mix. Pour the water. It is now left for a cooking of 5 hours, even 6 or 7 hours if you can.</li>
            <li>The sauce will make fat (but that's what's good!). Add salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>For me, it's 7 hours of cooking the first day, then I do another hour of cooking the next day. Be careful to always watch so that the bottom does not run out of water. Then, when you have cooked everything for 6 or 7 hours, reduce and evaporate the water to have a relatively consistent sauce.</li>
            <li>For me, when I see the bottom of the casserole with the spoon, it's good! Taste to adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>I also make my homemade lasagna. The advantage is that you don't need them to be perfect, because you cut into the dish. My recipe is  here  !</li>
            <li>I put the dough in a stretch film and then chill for an hour before rolling it out.</li>
            <li>I go to number 3 of my laminator. Then I let the lasagna dry completely.</li>
            <li>There on the photo, they are perfectly dry. But you can also make the dish without drying the lasagna. It's just that this way they keep for a very long time!</li>
            <li>The same day (or you can skip this step if the lasagna has not been dried), cook the lasagna for 30 seconds in salted boiling water, just to soften it.</li>
            <li>In the gratin dish (I made two small ones) put a layer of lasagne in the bottom.</li>
            <li>Pour in a third of the stew. and spread it over the pasta layer.</li>
            <li>Scatter peas</li>
            <li>Place a few slices of mozzarella and sprinkle with grated parmesan.</li>
            <li>Put a layer of dough and redo the same operation with ragout, peas, mozzarella and parmesan. A final layer of dough and a final layer of stew, this time without peas or mozzarella. Simply sprinkle with grated parmesan. Also pepper the top.</li>
            <li>Bake for 35 minutes at 185°C</li>
            <li>Cut into slices and serve with a little grated parmesan and finely chopped flat-leaf parsley!</li>
